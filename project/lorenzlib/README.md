# lorenzlib
The reusable yet simple-to-use tools-utils generic library for your bare metal uP project!

# Author's notes
No need to explain. The (in)famous library containing all sort of generic tools.

# Features
- Simple API
- Integer math
- Cross-Platform due to standard C and careful coding

# Available services
- Byte string conversions
- Limiting and scaling
- Safe sum and sub
- Checksum (CRC16-CCITT)

# MISRA
The code should (almost) follow MISRA rules with some exeptions. Please be aware that I did NOT run an analyzer tool yet, hence there is no guarantee the code actually is. The fact is the code has been compiled without warnings nor strange behavior on a 64-bit Linux machine
