This first design was involving the several devices and connections:

atmega328 - MASTER      - GUI, 2x 10bit PWM, 2x 8bit PWM
attiny85  - SLAVE CH 1  - 2x ADC, SW-UART to master
attiny85  - SLAVE CH 2  - 2x ADC, SW-UART to master

The main issue is that the primary requirement is to have 2 fully independent
channels and this implies the 2 channels to be fully isolated (i.e. no common
ground/earth).
The solution is to use the attiny85 on the isolated side to perform ADC
readings and then transfer them via an optocoupled UART link (one-wire)
On the other hand, the 2 PWM signals are sent through an optoisolator and then
buffered and cleaned up by the usage of a CMOS/TTL Schmitt-Trigger buffer stage.

Most optocouplers (say, the ones I have at disposal) have a rise time and a fall
time which are in the range 2-10 us and this can pose a problem when handling
mid-high PWM frequencies and small duty cycles.
Some success has been observed when the optocoupler is really fine-tuned and
its bias point spot-on: the resulting waveform was quite accurate, with a slight
delay of about 2 us and an error of about +1% on the duty cycle.
Why +1%? This is because the fall time of the optocouplers is generally much higher
than the rise time (at least 2-4 times) due to photo-transistor capacitance and
since the stage is inverting the schmitt trigger buffer is "more time on" with
respect to the original waveform.
Some data:

PWM supply voltage: 5V

Part: 4N35   - LED 330Ohm - LOAD 10kOhm - BASE 39kOhm [base resistor helps high falling time]
Part: PS2565 - LED 330Ohm - LOAD 330Ohm

Both configurations are giving good results with a frequency of ~3kHz.

Transfering a (low freq) PWM signal through an optocoupler is well possible within a certain
degree of accuracy and precision but a low frequency also means unacceptable ripple levels.
The major observed problem is part selection: every part has its own characteristic and the
PWM relies on precision duty cycle factor and on-off times which is not obtainable in a
consistent way between parts (and by "parts" also samples of the same "part"), and bias
adjusting is slightly different.
Moreover, my knowledge about the topic is not sufficient to easily find a way to tackle
the biasing problem and overcome the slow rising and falling times.
Last but not least, good performing optocouplers are costly and not suitable for a hobby
project in the long term (difficult to repair/upgrade, etc...)

=> Hence this desing is left aside for the moment.
